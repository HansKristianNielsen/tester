    <h2>Welcome to my website</h2>
    <p>The work I provide is of highest quality, fully responsive, and tested in a wide range of devices. I take great care to ensure each project is well-documented and easily maintainable so you can enhance a website as your company grows.</p>
    <p>Often front-end development of a website is overlooked, but being the part of your project that combines design, back-end development and the layer that your users interact with, from my experience, it is the most important to get right.</p>
	<p>My clients have found that launching with a well considered and well developed front-end has saved them time and money and makes for a product that is consistently of high quality.</p>
	<h2>Learn More</h2>
	<p>If you’d like to find out more about how I work and my process of working with clients, please visit the <a href="#">hire page</a> and give a little information about the project you have in mind. I’ll send a Getting Started guide that answers many of the common questions I receive from potential clients. We can then set up a call to discuss how I can be of most value to your project.</p>
